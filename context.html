    <h1>But what exactly is child labor?</h1>
    <div class="t1">
        <div class="txt">
            <p>Child labor is a serious issue that affects the lives of millions of children around the world, including
                Brazil. The legislation establishes guidelines to protect the rights of children and adolescents in
                relation to work. The total tradition of child labor is established until the age of 13, guaranteeing
                the opportunity to grow and develop appropriately, without compromising their education and health. From
                the age of 14 to 16, teenagers can work, but under the condition of being hired as an apprentice – in
                the Young Apprentice Program. The law allows young people to work partially, as long as certain
                restrictions are respected. The International Labor Organization (ILO) aims to eradicate child labor
                around the world, but we are still far from achieving this goal.

            <p class="t2">Child labor is recognized as one of the most harmful forms of exploitation to the full
                development of human beings. Its effects leave marks that often become irreversible and last into

                excessive fatigue, respiratory problems, diseases caused by pesticides, spinal injuries and deformities,
                allergies, sleep disorders, irritability. According to the Ministry of Health, children and adolescents
                have accidents six times more often than adults during work activities because they have less awareness
                of dangers. Fractures, mutilations, injuries caused by sharp objects, burns, bites by venomous animals
                and death are examples of work accidents.

            <p class="t4">Physical, sexual and emotional abuse are the main factors in the illness of working children
                and adolescents. Other problems identified are: social phobia, isolation, loss of affection, low

    <h1>EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS:</h1>

            <p class="t5">low school performance, age-grade distortion, school dropout and non-completion of Basic
                Education. It is worth noting that the earlier an individual starts working, the lower their salary in
                adulthood. This is largely due to low academic performance and impairment in the learning process. It is
                a vicious cycle that limits employment opportunities to positions that require low qualifications and
                low pay, perpetuating poverty and social exclusion.
