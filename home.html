        <h1>What is child labor?</h1>
        <p>Child labor refers to any form of work performed by children and adolescents below the minimum age allowed by
          the legislation of each country. In Brazil, work is generally prohibited for those under 16 years old.
          However, in the case of apprenticeships, it is permitted from the age of 14. If the work is nighttime,
          hazardous, unhealthy, or included in the TIP (Worst Forms of Child Labor) list, the prohibition extends to
          individuals under 18 years of age.</p>

          turned 16, as a general rule. When carried out as an apprentice, it is permitted from the age of 14. If it is
